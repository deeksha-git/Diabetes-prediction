# Obesity-prediction
This project studies the efficiency of Random Forest for predicting Obesity in patients. 

Obesity is one of the most common medical conditions that over 13% of the world's population struggle with. Although current Machine Learning techniques have advanced towards applying Deep learning and explainable AI in early obesity onset prediction, traditional ML models such as Random Forest still find strong application to obesity prediction due to their robust nature and much easily explainable decision-making, which is a current concern with black box models for doctors and physicians. 

Therefore, the performance of Random Forest to classify obesity type has been studied in this project. The target variable is classified into 6 classes as follows:  
Insufficient weight  
Normal_Weight  
Overweight_Level_I   
Overweight_Level_II  
Obesity_Type_I  
Obesity_Type_II       
Obesity_Type_III
